# Rick and Morty Character Search

## Description
This project is a web application that allows users to search for and explore information about characters from the famous TV series "Rick and Morty". It utilizes the public Rick and Morty API to fetch character data and displays the results in the form of cards, showing details for each character such as their image, name, status, location, and species.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Search: The search bar enables users to input a character's name and view real-time results, displaying only the characters that match the search term.
- Character Pagination: Users can load more characters by clicking the "Load More Characters" button, which fetches new characters without affecting the previously filtered search results.
- Status Highlighting: Characters are visually differentiated based on their status; living characters appear in green, deceased characters in red, and characters with unknown status in gray.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the webpage's structure and layout.
- CSS: Styles the page and character cards.
- JavaScript: Manages the application's logic and interactions with the API and users.
- Rick and Morty API: Utilized to retrieve character information.
